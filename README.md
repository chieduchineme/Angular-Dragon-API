# dragon-api

Simple Angular application made with Angular CLI consuming Dragons API.
Although the project was simple, it was thinking about a scalable structure.
Thinking about this scalability, the modularized approach was chosen.
The intention was to maintain a cohesive structure that provides benefits for finding bugs and fixing them.

## Development server

Run `npm run start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm test` to run the tests once.
Run `npm run test: watch` or `npm run test -- --watch` to run unit tests with the option to automatically reload and search for files.
Developed in Jest [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `npm run e2e or npm run cypress` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/overview/why-cypress.html).

The tests are available in the <b>application</b> folder.
